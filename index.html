							<h2>Investment Strategy & Nvidia Stock Forecast <br>(2025 to 2027)</h2>
							<h4><u>Research Question</u></h4>
							<h4>Does Nvidia’s current stock price (company’s value) accurately reflect its true market value and demand in the semiconductor industry from 2025 to 2027?</h4>
								<ul>
									<li><u>Specific:</u> Defined Nvidia as the investment target company and focused on its stock trend</li>
									<li><u>Measurable:</u> Stock price trend, market demand, company’s intrinsic value</li>
									<li><u>Achievable:</u> The listed company’s financial and company performances are accessible</li>
									<li><u>Relevant:</u> In 2024, hot money flooded into AI market investments, and Nvidia is a significant company in the AI and semiconductor sectors. The company’s valuation is relevant to the investment market</li>
									<li><u>Time-bounded:</u> 2025 to 2027</li>
								</ul>
							<br>
							<h4><u>Assessment</u></h4>
							<h4>3 main financial methods to assess Nvidia’s true enterprise value:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model</li>
									<li>Linear Regression for future stock simulation</li>
									<li>Correlation of the stock price trend with Oracle and Cisco </li>
								</ul>
							<br>
							<h4><u>Conclusion</u></h4>
							<h4>The analysis is expected to yield one of two possible conclusions:</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Buy Now. Nvidia's stock is advised for investment.</li>
									<li>Hold Off. Nvidia's stock is not advised for investment due to the concern of overpricing. This may lead to a potential risk of a financial bubble.</li>
								</ol>
							<h4>This project provides a fundamental understanding of Nvidia's stock price evaluation based on the current market environment. The project examines key factors and trends without assuming unusual market behaviors. This provides investors with a better insight into minimizing risk and optimizing investment returns.</h4>
							<br>
							<h4>The prediction is based on current internal factors, market behavior, and the environment. According to the DCF model and linear regression analysis, the stock price is overvalued. There is a downtrend for Nvidia’s stock price in the next 3 years. The current company value does not reflect the true market value. Nvidia might have a potential risk of bubbling. Therefore, a hold-off on the investment of Nvidia’s stock is recommended.</h4>
							<br>
							<h4>Future external factors, such as unusual market behaviors and worldwide government policies, can affect the predicted results. Further investigation and more comprehensive analyses are required to examine potential risks. The plan is to monitor Nvidia’s financial performance closely and track the latest market information monthly from 2025 to 2027 to make necessary adjustments in the model prediction.</h4>
